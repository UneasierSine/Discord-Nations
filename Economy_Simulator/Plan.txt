Basically this simulation will take a certain type of deal, for example a trade deal or development and will calculate the gdp growth via
weighted dice. 

Economy Simulation:
  Trade:
    There will be four parameters to be inputted into the simulation. These parameters will be country gdp 1, country gdp 2, trade deal
    value, and total imports/ exports of the country. The simulation will work by you taking the average of the gdp. Then, you will take 
    the value of the trade deal and divide it by the total imports/exports of the country. Then you will take the average gdp of the 
    country and do GDP mod dice roll.
  Building Simulation:
    there will be x paramters to be inputted into the simulation. The parameters we take in will be gdp of country,
